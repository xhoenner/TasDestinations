Favourite walks/places to see:
  * Short walks around Hobart: Waterworks, Hobart rivulet track, Mt Wellington summit via Pipeline and Zig Zag tracks
  * Bruny Island: Fluted Cape, Cape Queen Elisabeth, Cloudy Bay
  * Cockle Creek and the 4 hour walk return to South East Cape
  * Lake Pedder and Lake Gordon: Mt Eliza and Mt Anne, Lake Judd, Western Arthurs. Nearby, in the Florentine, the 6 hour walk (one way) to Lake Rhona is one of my favourites, taking you to a glacial lake surrounded by 200m cliffs with tannin-rich waters and pristine white sand on which you're allowed to camp.
  * Tasman Peninsula: Also one of my favourite spots as it is where the Tasman Sea meets the Southern Ocean, creating a unique combinate of climate and stunning diversity of ecosystems. The walk to all three capes (Cape Pillar, Cape Hauy, Cape Raoul) can be done as day walks. Cape Pillar is the most stunning but the longest to reach, well worth it though. Make sure to check out the beautiful white sand beach and turquoise water of Fortescue Bay, and watch out for snakes, they seem particularly abundant on the peninsula. Also note that near the start of the walk to Cape Raoul is the walk that leads you to the famous surfing spot Shipstern Bluff
  * Maria Island: pristine island without any vehicle. Guaranteed to see wombats and kangaroos. Very, very peaceful with gorgeous scenery.
  * Freycinet Ntl Park: walk to Mt Amos, camp at Wineglass Bay or do the three day walk around the Freycinet peninsula. One option nearby to leave the van overnight is at Friendly Beaches, which is also a good surfing spot
  * Bay of Fires near St Helens: a cool camping spot there is Cosy Corner. 
  * Launceston: multiple walks near Cataract Gorge. Nearby is Hollibanks Treetop Adventure for some fun and exercise in the trees.
  * Walls of Jerusalem Ntl Park: never been but have been told it is as stunning as Cradle Mtn and less touristy.
  * Cradle Mountain Ntl Park: the walk to Crater lake is incredible. If weather permits, push to Kitchen Hut and to the summit. Check with Parks and Wildlife, but if allowed it's worth staying at Waterfall Valley Hut for an ascent of Barn Bluff the next day.
  * Stanley: cute little coastal town in the NW corner of Tassie. Make sure to walk around the Nut, the diversity of plants and climate up there is quite remarkable.
  * Corinna: on the West coast, hard to get to but beautiful campsites along the Arthur-Pieman river, with a pub just nearby and the possibility to hire kayaks
  * Strahan: the end of the world. Make sure to check out Ocean Beach. I've been told the scenic river cruises to tour Macquarie Harbour are worth doing.
  * Lake St Clair: Frenchmans Cap, Mt Rufus, many walks North of the lake (which can be accessed by ferry to save you a 16 km walk in the rainforest) including the Labyrinth and the Acropolis


Shopping: the best quality, organic, mostly local produce can be found either at Eumarrah (also in Launceston) or Unpacked. Otherwise good produce can be found in Hobart at the Salamanca market on Saturday and at the Farmers market on Sunday. 
  At St Helens there's a health shop called Going Nuts.

Favourite places to eat out in Hobart: 
  * Pub: Preachers, The Hanging Gardens, Fern Tree tavern, Longley pub
  * Indian: Maharajah
  * Pizzas: Local Pizza near MONA, or Ti Amo on Salamanca
  * Cafe: Ginger Brown in South Hobart, Park Lane on Salamanca, Yellow Bernard in town
* St Helens: Really good coffee nearby can be had at St Helens, at The Lifebuoy Cafe & Quail Street Emporium.
