# Simple interactive Leaflet app showcasing the best destinations in Tasmania
What to do, where to stay or eat? Here's a sample of my favourite spots around our beautiful island. 
Top right corner icons allow you to change the base map and visualise weather data. 
Most photos are my own, unless it's a place I haven't visited or haven't bothered taking an image of.
Feel free to contribute to this project by dropping me a line!

## To do list
	1. Add URLs for more resources at the bottom of the map and statement to assume no responsibility, at your own risk, and that the site is updated infrequently
	2. Review content, incl. prices? Or just say prices as of 2022?
	3. Ability to filter by activity!
